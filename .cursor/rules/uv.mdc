# Only Use UV for project management

- When running a tool which uses dependencies in this project, always use `uv run`.
- When changing dependencies, always make the changes in the `pyproject.toml`

Here's an example command to run paper-loupe:
```bash
uv run paper-loupe ...
```

Here's an example command to run all tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

Here's an example command to run a specific module:
```bash
uv run -m paper_loupe.email_processor
```
